 Bed and breakfast.

 The most coined phrase for a motel.

 Yet, bed and lunch was the most coined phrase for Mr.Teddy, as for himself,
 the heavy burden of polypropene cotton not only stresses him physically,
 but also pins him down to the ceiling like an anchor gripped onto a soothing harbour.

 The stagnance of his sleeves, the eternal clog of his fleece. He sits windowside,
 laying like a wooden plank on a rather disagreeable cactus which prickles at Mr.Teddy’s entire existence.

 	“Mom! I’m off to work!”

 	Teddy, is off to work too.
 As soon as Harris disappears from sight, Teddy rolls off the cactus, the windowsill, and finally the bed.
 Pulling himself to his feet, he surveys the scatter of toys around him, beginning to stir.
 His trusty partner, the Gray Bunny, was nowhere to be seen, while his apprentice-partner, the Cheese Mouse,
 still has his face buried in his hunk of cottony cheese.

 “Mouse,” he barked. “Where’s the hare?”

 “On your head,” the Mouse murmured, eyes shut and smiling.

 Teddy walks over and takes a swing at the fuzzy gray head, but the mouse ducks away as always.

 “I don’t know where he is,” Mouse protests. “Haven’t seen him since lights out.”

 Teddy glances at the mounted clock. Five past eight. It was time to move.

 What does Teddy do?
 1. Search for Bunny
 2. Set off with Mouse
