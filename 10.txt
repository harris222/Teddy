Stick to the Plan

Teddy turns to Mouse. 

“Carry on,” he says without a hint of stress. 

With that, he jumped up high in the air, towing the Mouse after him. 

The Stickmen were too shocked to react. Some drop pieces as they watched. 

Tsk, tsk. Too young. Harris must have been doodling just last afternoon. 

In mid-air, he kicks open the door. Arrows shoot in, but they hit the stickmen instead of the screechy Mouse. When Teddy lands, it was on his squire’s back. 

Boink!

Out of the corner of his eye Teddy sees the Bed Toad throw whips of sludge their way, but they were already into the light and he could go no further. 

Boink, boink! They bounce towards the door. All along the way they are chased by arrows, claws, wheels and arrow-shooting ninjas, but nothing hits them. 

Teddy smirks. 

All the while the Mouse shrieks inwardly. 

Finally, with one last bounce, they make it out the door. 

The Mouse wrenches the Cheese out of his throat and they flop to the floor. 

Teddy was about to pick up the Bunny and scurry down to water when he suddenly noticed the Mouse frozen beside him, eyes unfocused. 

“Oh great, now he’ll be dead for a day.” sighed Teddy as blood rushes up to his head while he looks at Mouse’s dead eyes.

For turned his way was Harris’s grandfather, a look of surprise on his face. 

What does Teddy do?
1. Run. With Bunny. The mouse will wake up when he’s out of sight, after all. 
2. Play dead beside Mouse.
