“Kill the Toad for the sake of the Bunny!” yells Teddy chivalrously. “Go, young squire!”

“Hey, who you calling a squire, young blood?” bickers Mouse back at Teddy. 

“Have you ever gone down by the waterfront before, you two?” inquires the Bed Toad nonchalantly, as if he feels no threat at all. 

Teddy and Mouse pounce at the Bed Toad. Teddy throws punches, while Mouse clatters his fangs.

“Ah, his skin is so sticky!” complains Teddy, as he punches are obstructed by some gooey resistance. 

“It tastes like peanut butter,” gurgles Mouse in abominance. 

“Such a pity that you can not reach me, eh?” laughs the Bed Toad out loud, in an eminent plot armour. “So, what will you do, you stank wankers?” 

What will Teddy do?
1. Rebel against Toad’s gooey skin. 
2. Hug Toad’s skin.
