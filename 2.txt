“Alright,” Teddy barks. “Let’s go. We’ve got no time to look for that furball.”

Mouth set into a disappointed straight line, Teddy plodded towards the huge white door. The other toys were just waking up, and he had to detour around a twitching felt paw, a plastic chassis and several stacks of books. The mouse followed him swervily, head buried in his cheese. 

“Mouse!” he barked, when they got to the door. “Routine 2!”

“What?” the Mouse suddenly became alert. “Get the hare...ahh...no, I didn’t sleep well! I won’t reach it!”

But Teddy was already bending down, with an angry expression that pulled the Mouse closer. 

“This is the last tiiiiiime…” he called as he was launched into the air.

The Mouse stuffed the cheese into his mouth as he flew. On the way down, he grabbed ahold of the door handle and hung on until it turned. 

Teddy dragged the door open by the Mouse’s tail. 

“You’ll rip me soooon,” the Mouse complained the moment he touched down, rubbing his tail.

Teddy ignored him and peeked outside the room.

All clear. 

“Let’s go,” he ordered, and dashed to the next hide point -- the next doorway. 

The Mouse trudged glumly down the middle of the hallway. “I don’t see the point to this...never anyone…”

The squire suddenly froze, his ears extended and his eyes wide. 

Teddy held back a grunt. 

For before the stairs there suddenly came the sound of a footstep. Not someone coming down the staircase, no. That would give them ample time to hide. This was someone lying in wait, around the bend of those stairs.

Mouse was in imminent danger of being exposed and frozen for a day.

What should Teddy do?
Save Mouse -- or try to
Let him be punished for his stupidity
