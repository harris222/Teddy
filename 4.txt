Save Mouse -- Or Try To

Sand… sand… 
	
A soft shuffling noise, resembling the crushing of sandpaper, approaches Mouse and Teddy at a subtly frightening pace.

“Duck, Mouse. Duck!” Teddy whispers as loud as he can. 

A man dressed in a saggy full plate armour runs past the two, as metal rumbles and resonates all around the staircase.

“Ouch! My ears-” whimpers the Mouse. 

“Will you be quiet, Mouse?” exclaims Teddy in a hot-headed temper, which was about to erupt like the Icelandic Volcanoes. “Don’t you realize what’s going on here? First, we’re in the 21st century. Second, the stairwell is embedded with torches. And third, a strange knight in full metal armor just ran past us. Did you bonk your head on a metal helm or something? Can’t you realize there’s something rotten happening in Denmark! For god’s sakes. Be quiet!”

Mouse whimpers again, but this time does not say anything. 

Teddy grunts, and turns the corner at the staircase, as Mouse follows in a reserved body language, shoulders shrugging and arms crossed. They expect to reach an exit, but don’t come to a stop. Turning and turning they go, in an infinite helix. Mouse is starting to feel lightheaded, while Teddy, although still infuriated by Mouse’s defiant behaviour, is panting under his palms.  

“When is it ever going to end?” whimpers Mouse. “I don’t think I’ve ever burned off so many pounds of cheese in my life!”

“Stop complaining, Mouse.” pants Teddy. “I ain’t even soddy one bit.” Oh, Teddy. No one will want to feel salivas trickling down your cotton. 

“You should just disintegrate right now.” whimpers Mouse in a more biting accent. “Let’s just head back up. I want more cheese pudding.”

  
What should Teddy do?
Go back for pudding with Mouse?
Continue trotting down the stairwell.
