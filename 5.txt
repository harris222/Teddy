Teddy knew that Mouse was going to be seen, and subsequently frozen for a day. 

But that was his own fault. It’s not like Teddy didn’t tell him to be careful every single time. 

He’ll be fine. Frozen for a bit, but unharmed. 

Teddy ignored him and continued towards the stairs. 

Bam!

Teddy was struck by a mysterious creature and flew over the handrails into an alternate universe in which he was apprenticed to Mouse.
