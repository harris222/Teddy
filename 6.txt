The Bunny did not move when they approached. 

Teddy felt his partner’s forehead and was greeted by a handful of sharp bristles. 

He took a sharp breath. Glue.

“Quick, we need to get him to water!”

He picked up the Bunny in one of his arms. Extra stiff, with fur-thorns all over. “Mouse!”

The apprentice wanted to groan, but sensed it was not a good time.

So instead, he took a deep whiff of his cheese, and stuck his front paw into one of its holes. 

Then he took the biggest breath he could, and jammed the Cheese in his own throat. 

Immediately the Mouse began to bounce. Teddy grabbed his tail and was about to push open the door when a voice behind them said, 

“Well, well, well.”

The closet lit up. 

The Mouse choked nervously. 

It was a wholly familiar voice -- the Bed Toad. More sludge than toad, this was the monster that haunts every first grader’s night. 

Teddy’s Nemesis #8. 

The door was barred by stickmen, uneven figures drawn by hands influenced to shake by subconscious nightmares. 

What does Teddy do?
1. Stick to the plan - no failure is guaranteed
2. Improv time.
