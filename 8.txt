Grrr…

As Teddy berated his squire-apprentice, his stomach suddenly rumbled.

“Aha!” Mouse exclaimed. “You’re hungry! Why? Because we ate nothing this morning! Nothing! And I had to be your flexible door-opener, and run from…”

He stopped blabbing and ducked just in time to avoid being walloped from his sire. 

Grrr…

The Mouse was right. They would usually have flower-leaf sandwich, cheese pudding, cheese tart and cheesecake for breakfast, but the disappearance of Bunny messed up their routine. 

“Alright!” Teddy gave in angrily. “We will go back for food. But only because we won’t have the energy to defeat our enemies if we don’t.”

The Mouse’s eyes gleamed. 

“Oh, I forgot,” the Mouse said when they turned around. “We have to climb back up.”

Climb back up. An enormously long staircase reserved for only two trips a day. One down, one up.

Teddy smirked. “No free lunches under the sky.”

“Breakfasts! There are free breakfasts!” The Mouse complained. “Besides, it’s not like we pay for our food…”

No, they do not. They get it from a magic hat. 

“No gain, no pain,” Teddy said with satisfaction, and began to climb up the stairs. 

It took them an untalliably long time to return to the top landing, and another untalliably long time to get back to the room. 

“Because someone insists on stopping every half a step, for a meal’s time,” the Mouse grumbled. 

“Because someone was almost caught and frozen for a day,” Teddy snarls right back under his breath. 

At last they stood outside the enormous white door. 

It was closed. 

“Mouse!” Teddy called. “Routine…”

“Noooo!” Mouse yelled, cutting him off. 

With that, he passed out at Teddy’s feet. 

What should Teddy do?
1. Revive Mouse - apprentice is priority
2. Get them both inside first - need to be secure
3. Ditch Mouse at the door. He’ll be fine.
